# How to calculate FPKM, or TPM????


#chi-square test
# for 2-way tables you can use chisq.test(mytable) to test independence of the
# row and column variable. By default, the p-value is calculated from the
# asymptotic chi-squared distribution of the test statistic
# optionally, the p-value can be derived via Monte Carlo simulation

#fisher exact test
# fisher.test(x) provides an exact test of independence
# x is a two dimensional contingency table in matrix Formaldehyde

#wilcoxon test
wilcox.test(1:10, 1:20)
#why dont we use t test?
